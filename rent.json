Fair Market Rents (FMRs) are primarily used to determine payment standard amounts for the Housing Choice Voucher program, to determine initial renewal rents for some expiring project-based Section 8 contracts, to determine initial rents for housing assistance payment (HAP) contracts in the Moderate Rehabilitation Single Room Occupancy program (Mod Rehab), and to serve as a rent ceiling in the HOME rental assistance program. FMRs are gross rent estimates. They include the shelter rent plus the cost of all tenant-paid utilities, except telephones, cable or satellite television service, and internet service. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) annually estimates FMRs for 530 metropolitan areas and 2,045 nonmetropolitan county FMR areas. Under certain conditions, as set forth in the Interim Rule (Federal Register Vol. 65, No. 191, Monday October 2, 2000, pages 58870-58875), these 50th percentile rents can be used to set success rate payment standards.", "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "downloadURL": "http://www.HUDuser.org/portal/datasets/50thper/FY2014_50_Final.xls", "mediaType": "application/xls"}], "identifier": "HUD009", "keyword": ["HUD", "fmr", "housing assistance", "rents", "section 8 contracts"], "modified": "2009-04-10", "programCode": ["025:000"], "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "US Department of Housing and Urban Development"}, "title": "50th Percentile Rent Estimates"}
